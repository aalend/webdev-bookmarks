# Web Dev Bookmarks
Web Dev Bookmarks are collection of helpful links where you can easily find what you need. üòä

Bookmarks will be added once a week!

If you like this repo, be sure to hit that ‚≠ê button, will help a lot!

I come with this idea because I don't want to keep my bookmarks in browser, and I think that here will be easier to maintain it.
