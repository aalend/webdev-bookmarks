# Web Dev Bookmarks
Web Dev Bookmarks are a collection of helpful links where you can find what you need. üòä

Bookmarks will be adding bookmarks once a week!

If you like this repo, be sure to hit that ‚≠ê button, will help a lot!

I come with this idea because I don't want to keep my bookmarks in the browser, and that here will be easier to maintain.
